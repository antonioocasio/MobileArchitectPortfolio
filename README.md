### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of the inventory application was to create an application for a user to keep track of items in a database. The needs included tracking, databse, and login security. 

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The most necessary feature was the database, this allowed the application to keep track of users and the correct number of items. The necessary screens was a login screen, create user screen, and inventory screen. It was centered around the user by having a minimalist setup so the user does not get overwhelmed. 

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The way that I approached programming this application was by drawing how I want the UI to look. I then designed pseudocode in the order that I think is best starting with the login screen, the create user screen and finally the database. 

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested my application by adding test users to the database and then I added and removed items from the database to make sure it was functional. 

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The most challenging part was implementing the database. I have never added a database into a mobile application before so this was a challegne but I was able to compelte it by reading the documentation. 

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The most successful part of my application was the user login, I was successfully able to add a user to the database and login with the credentials. If the user account was not setup, it would take them to the create user screen and help them sign up to get access to the application.
